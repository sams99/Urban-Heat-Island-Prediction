# Urban-Heat-Island-Prediction
Modeling vegetation geometries and densities to understand their impact on Urban Heat Islands in Washington D.C.

Urban trees play an important role in regulating urban climates and keeping cities cool during intense heat waves and can prevent the formation of the Urban Heat Island effect. All around the world, cities are implementing tree planting and canopy conservation pro- grams in response to global climate change. However, when it comes to tree planting, are some programs and strategies more effective than others? Using Satellite Land Surface Temperature data and sev- eral modeling algorithms, we explore the relationship between tree canopy density and Urban Heat Island mitigation in Washington, D.C., where urban summertime temperatures are expected to rise into the next century. The results herein will assist urban planners and foresters prioritize tree-planting projects, especially when re- sources are limited. In addition, the techniques used to retrieve the data, the use of machine learning models, and the use of a thermal resilience simulation will provide a foundation for future modeling of Urban Heat Island mitigation strategies
